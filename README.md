💡 fix icue bug on windows where it spazzes out

## Usage

Double-click the `.lnk` file to run the `.bat` script as administrator. This will kill the two service processes that frequently collide with a new instance of the iCue app, and then relaunch the app so it can manage them properly once more.

## License

See [LICENSE](LICENSE). If you'd like to use icue for something, reach out to me on [🐤 Twitter](https://twitter.com/insanj) or [👾 Github](https://github.com/insanj)!
